Welcome!

The functional paradigm is a pretty old way of solving problems: [its origins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) date back to 1930's, when computers didn't even exist.

Although these ideas were developed by mathematicians, good news are you don't need to know maths to understand and take advantage of it... well, perhaps your ability to sum and multiply could be useful. :stuck_out_tongue:

This paradigm is **very simple**, but lets you do **very powerful things**: with a few tools you can do everything. That's why we say _functional programming_ allows you to **conquer the world with nothing**.

Enough introduction, let's start programming using the Haskell language! Join us!
