Let's start with something simple: numbers. In Haskell we have numbers like `4`, `1.5`, `-89` or `200139`.

We can have numbers as small or big as we want!

And what can we do with a number? Well, for instance we can label it, to give it some meaning. For instance, if within a Haskell program you want to say that a week has 7 days, you can write:

```haskell
daysPerWeek = 7
```

If you want to say that [the solar system has 8 planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System), you can write:

```haskell
planetsOfTheSolarSystem = 8
```

> Try it yourself: write a Haskell program saying that `daysOfJanuary` is 31.
